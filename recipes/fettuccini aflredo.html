    <h1>Fettuccini Alfredo</h1>
    <img src="fettuccine_alfredo_image.jpg">
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Parmesan Cheese</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Ground Black Pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <p>Slowly mix the flour and eggs together, usually in a ratio of 1 egg per 
        100g of flour. One egg should feed about one person. After the mixture
        starts to form a dough, knead heavily until the dough becomes smooth
        and even. Cover with plastic wrap and leave to rest for 30 mins - 1 hour.
        Roll the pasta with a machine or rolling pin, until they are thin enough
        to be slightly translucent. (Pasta thickens when it boils!) Cut it into 
        Fettuccini length and width with a pasta machine or with a knife. Boil for
        only a few minutes! Fresh pasta cooks very quickly. Keep the water
        you cooked the pasta in, and use that as the base for your sauce. Add
        generous butter and extra generous grated parmesan cheese. Mix on low heat
        to emulsify (combine). Toss in pasta and top with black pepper.
